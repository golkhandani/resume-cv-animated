            <h3>How this assessment could improve the learning process</h3>
            <p><strong>1. What is the purpose of your assessment?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This assessment will evaluate students' ability to recognize situations that need to be addressed
                    with Array.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>2. Identify the content (goals/outcomes) that are going to be assessed by this formative
                    assessment.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recognize gaps between students to support peer learning and reduce performance gaps.</li>
                <li>Determine effective teaching methods and identify issues in the lesson plan to tailor learning.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>3. What factors did you consider when designing your assessment?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Focus questions on the concept of Array, not language-specific implementations.</li>
                <li>Cover various Array use cases and provide hints for clarity.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>4. Procedures and responsibilities of both the students and the teacher.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Students: Stick to core concepts, use creativity and trial/error techniques.</li>
                <li>Teachers: Provide hints, remain available, encourage understanding, and boost confidence.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>5. How the assessment supports student learning:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allows the teacher to personalize instruction and adjust the lesson plan.</li>
                <li>Helps students recognize their learning gaps.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Note: Formative assessment helps surface misconceptions and inform instruction. Referencing Dr.
                    Shuchi Grover’s framework.</em></p>

            <h3>Array, File and Search Assessment</h3>
            <p><strong>A)</strong> Write a flow of the below application:</p>
            <p>A program for a coffee ordering machine that stores the data of each customer throughout the day, along
                with their orders. Customers' orders should be processed according to the priority they give as input.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design the model and properties for each order.</li>
                <li>Use files, arrays, and sorting functions to solve the problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Hints:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consider storage limitations and cleanup operations.</li>
                        <li>Choose one or multiple files strategically to manage flow.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>B)</strong> At the end of the day, the machine specialist should be able to see the list of
                customers and their orders. Be creative and optimize the process by reducing redundancy.</p>
            <p><strong>C)</strong> Which capability of Array should be used for a delete flow?</p>
            <p><strong>D)</strong> What capability of the Operating System should be used to add a new item to the order
                list?</p>
