            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>The last decade of my life was spent working closely with industry. As a result, I understand the
                importance of collaboration and teamwork to develop a shared vision with other team members, management
                levels, and stakeholders. Effective communication is the key to project success.</p>
            <p>The experience I gained as a programming mentor for web development and an instructional technology
                student led me to realize that technology and education differ when it comes to developing programs.
                Most of the time, students' learning process and improvement have been sacrificed due to poor
                communication between those involved in decision-making.</p>
            <p>Education leaders and stakeholders must work closely with teachers and professionals in the education
                field to create a stimulating and engaging learning environment for diverse students. Working together,
                we should look at the latest and greatest technology and what can be accomplished with it to meet the
                needs of 21st-century students.</p>
            <p>Education has reached the point where traditional approaches are no longer appropriate to meet the
                changing needs of students. Consequently, the visionary planner standard stresses the importance of
                incorporating technology and innovative approaches into traditional educational methods to enhance
                student learning and meet future demands. Educational leaders should embrace technology and innovative
                approaches to create an engaging, challenging, and effective learning environment.</p>
            <p>Here is a small overview of ChatGPT to better understand the gap between industry and education. ChatGPT
                is one of the most intriguing technologies of our time and has been received by the educational
                community so far. Educators have expressed concern about plagiarism and the use of AI-generated texts as
                assignments for homework over the past few months. Still, there has yet to be much discussion about the
                potential benefits of such technology. As an educational leader, I am confident that we can help educate
                school board members and parents on how artificial intelligence can be integrated into the education
                system. As a result of this collaboration, industry visions can be aligned with community values, and it
                can assist students in meeting their diverse needs through collaboration between different stakeholders.
            </p>
            <p>After studying in the field of education for a few years, I developed an interest in cognitivism, and I
                have learned that I can apply the exact lifecycle of development to visionary planning by incorporating
                the development of cognitive abilities such as attention, memory, and problem-solving to have more
                effective communication with people on board. A key element to promoting effective learning is starting
                with the learning goals, considering equity, and using technology to enhance critical thinking and
                problem-solving skills to facilitate practical understanding. The impact of learning with technology can
                be seen in improved learning outcomes, the promotion of lifelong learning, and the creation of
                innovative thinking resulting from learning with technology.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly, establishing a visionary planner standard educational leadership is one of the most critical
                aspects of creating a learning environment that responds to students' varying needs, promotes
                innovation, and utilizes technology in such a way that learning is more effective and engaging.</p>
