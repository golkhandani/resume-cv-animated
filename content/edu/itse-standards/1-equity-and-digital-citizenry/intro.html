            <p><strong>Inclusive:</strong> Being open to multiple viewpoints and respectful in digital interactions. The
                internet must be created in a way that people can speak their opinions and respect others. In my
                opinion, we can improve ourselves most by listening and learning from others. By shutting down other
                viewpoints, we will stick with our beliefs and those who think like us, like a loop that will never
                break. The law and illegal behaviour should also be familiar to them as digital
                citizens.<br><em>Standards-wise, this aligns with ITSE standard 2 (digital citizen) for students and
                    ISTE standard 1 (equity and citizenship advocate) for educators.</em></p>

            <p><strong>Informed:</strong> Evaluating the accuracy, perspective and validity of digital media and social
                posts. I believe it is vital for students to be able to check if something is right or wrong on the
                internet as well as be critical thinkers. They can learn how to use different search engines and
                evaluate resources' reliability.<br><em>For education leaders, this aligns with ISTE standard 2
                    (visionary planner) and ITSE standard 3 (knowledge constructor) for students.</em></p>

            <p><strong>Engaged:</strong> Using technology for civic engagement, problem-solving and being a force for
                good. Using technology will help students make a difference in their communities and the world, in my
                opinion. In addition to learning collaboration and teamwork, it will teach them how to apply their
                creativity to projects that make a positive impact using technology.<br><em>The standards align with
                    ISTE standard 3 (Empowering Leader) and ITSE standard 6 (Creative Communicator) for education
                    leaders and students.</em></p>

            <p><strong>Balanced:</strong> Prioritizing time and activities online and off to promote mental and physical
                health. We have to teach students how to use technology responsibly. Sometimes, we need to be
                traditional, support both physical and mental health and wellness by helping students prioritize time
                online and offline, identify when and how it can be harmful to them, and see the big picture for life,
                like having a good work-life balance.<br><em>Standard alignment is with ISTE standard 4 (Systems
                    Designer) for education leaders and ITSE standard 7 (Global Collaborator) for students.</em></p>

            <p><strong>Alert:</strong> Being aware of online actions and their consequences and knowing how to be safe,
                and ensuring others are safe online. Online behaviour might affect students' personal information, so
                students should be aware of it. Protect themselves and anyone they relate to, including family,
                coworkers, and friends. They might get attacked not just because of their information but because of
                their employer, friends or family's information. They should be aware of all kinds of security issues
                and the ways they can protect themselves.<br><em>In terms of standards, this aligns with ITSE standard 5
                    (Computational Thinker) for students and ISTE standard 5 (Connected Learner) for education
                    leaders.</em></p>

            <h3>Why are equity and digital citizenry so crucial to you as an educator?</h3>
            <p>As a programming mentor, I believe equity and digital citizenship are integral parts of modern education.
                As we move into the digital age, it is essential that students have access to technology and learn to
                use it responsibly and ethically.</p>
            <p>To ensure that all students have access to technology and the necessary skills, equity is essential.
                Students may face obstacles such as limited technology resources or limited internet access. Equity
                gives students the opportunity to succeed in a fair and just society.</p>
            <p>Also, for students to be responsible digital citizens is equally critical. It includes skills such as
                online safety, ethical behaviour, and critical thinking. Online safety starts with protecting yourself,
                respecting others' privacy rights, and evaluating the credibility and reliability of online information.
            </p>
            <p>Through technology integration and digital citizenship, students can develop the skills and knowledge
                they need.</p>
