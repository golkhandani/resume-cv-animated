            <p>This section outlines the results and findings from a training needs assessment survey conducted among
                in-service educators. The objective was to understand current technology usage, barriers to adoption,
                and to guide a customized professional development program focused on Canva, Kahoot, and ChatGPT.</p>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>Professional development is critical for educators to stay current with educational technology and
                improve student outcomes. A survey was designed to assess the technological needs of teachers and
                identify how to structure a professional development program tailored to their environment.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>In alignment with the Ministry of Education in British Columbia and ISTE standards, a needs assessment
                was conducted at Westwood Elementary School. It revealed gaps in using technology to personalize
                learning and promote collaboration. The findings led to the design of a targeted training program to
                bridge these gaps.</p>

            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>A Google Form was distributed to around 20 in-service educators to collect anonymous responses about
                their current use of instructional technology and challenges faced. The survey helped identify major
                themes and areas needing support.</p>

            <h3>Results Summary</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Most educators serve college/university and elementary school levels.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Presentation tools and video conferencing were the most used
                    technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Teachers prioritized learning analytics and multimedia content
                    creation.</li>
                <li><strong>Question 4:</strong> Major barriers included managing technology and staying updated.</li>
                <li><strong>Question 5:</strong> Nearly half preferred in-person PD workshops.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recommendations</h3>
            <p>Based on the data, the following approaches are suggested:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interactive Multimedia Lessons:</strong> Use Canva for interactive visuals and digital
                    handouts.</li>
                <li><strong>Effective Assessment:</strong> Leverage Kahoot for engaging, gamified quizzes with
                    analytics.</li>
                <li><strong>Gamification:</strong> Integrate Canva and Kahoot to make learning more dynamic and
                    motivating.</li>
            </ul>
